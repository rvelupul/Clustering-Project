# Clustering-Project

This is my honors project completed in the spring of 2022 for my Algorithms and Complexity class. This project requires us to implement the clustering algorithm, which is a very important concept in machine learning and has many applications in data analysis. I implemented Kruskal's Algorithm and a version of the union find structure needed for its operation. For this project, the dataset is based on a set of images taken in color around the University of Massachusetts campus to which low-level image processing operators were applied. The goal is to find clusters in the data which define different types of objects (buildings, trees, sky etc). Purity was calculated as a measure of clustering quality and the optimal k value was found.
